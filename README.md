# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

If you have not  installed Vite globally on your system, the terminal won't recognize the vite command. You can install Vite globally by running:
`npm install -g vite`

make .env variable

After installing globally, try running `npm run dev` again.



If you prefer not to install Vite globally, you can install it locally within your project. In this case, you would need to use npx to run Vite commands. Install Vite locally by running:
`npm install vite`



After installing locally, you can run npm run dev using npx,
`npx vite`
